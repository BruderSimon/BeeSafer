** How to Compile
If you are using Visual Studio:
Follow the Instruction given in the Lecture (Setting up the OpenGL template - step by step)
Then you should be good to go!

If you are using another Compiler/Generator (like MinGW Makefiles)
I expect that you know what to do. Also the Executable will be copied to
the src directory. There you can execute it.

The Executable searchers the shader and resource directory in the same
directory where it is located.  So for example:
#+name: tree
#+begin_src ditaa
  BeeSafe      
  |
  +--build
  |   
  +--src   	   
  |  +--shader	   
  |  |  +--SimpleVertexshader.vertexshader
  |  |  +--SimpleFragmentshader.fragmentshader
	+--Fragmentshader.fragment
  |  +-- res  	   
  |  |    +--Bee.stl 
#+end_src
